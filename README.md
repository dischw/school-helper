# School Helper (React Native)

This is a React Native project created to replicate the core functionality of the original **School Assistant** Android app, rebranded as **School Helper**. It's scaffolded using Expo and is intended for personal or educational use. Features such as agendas, calendars, notes, and charts will be implemented.

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: Main entry point. Defines a topâ€‘tab navigator with placeholder screens (Agenda, Calendar, Notes, Charts).
